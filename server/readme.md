 ## INTRODUCTION TO AUTHENTICATION 
 ##
 In the authentication , we will going to provide some endpoints which will help
 users to register themselves and login . Once login they can use a access token
 and with the help of Access Token they can manage their contacts. 

We will create the entire backend project by using Common JS Module 
For the validation we will use Joi .
Create a middleware folder too
